# SceneKitVR
This was developed as a quick weekend project. Feel free to reuse any code included in this project. The core functionalilty of the VR engine is contained with the classes `VRView`, `VRViewportView`, `VRScene`, and `VRCamera`. If you create anything with this library, I'd love to see it.
